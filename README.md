# Tiny Project to use BLE String Characteristic
This is a tiny project as a practice to handle `BLEStringCharacteristic` in `ArduinoBLE`.

You can build code in this repository with PlatformIO. 
The default board in this repo is M5Stack Atom, on the other hand you can use any board which can use `ArduinoBLE`.
